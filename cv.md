# **ABOUT ME**

My name is Stanislav. I started my career as a manager and have spent the last five years working as a project manager.
Recently, I became interested in programming and have been taking various courses and intensive training sessions in my
spare time. My current goal is to become a developer, and the skills I have acquired as a project manager will
undoubtedly help me achieve this. I have extensive experience in client communication, handling large volumes of
information, and managing large-scale and long-term projects.

# CODE EXAMPLE

```
A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed.

function dataReverse(data) {
  const segmentSize = 8; // Each segment is 8 bits
  const segments = [];

  // Group bits into segments of 8
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += segmentSize) {
    segments.push(data.slice(i, i + segmentSize));
  }

  // Reverse the order of the segments
  segments.reverse();

  // Flatten the reversed segments back into a single array
  return segments.flat();
}
